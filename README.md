# Overview of the Project
# Vulnerability Scanning Tool
## Objective
#### This project is a Python-based Vulnerability Scanning Tool designed to scan a network or website for common security vulnerabilities. It checks for open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations using the nmap and requests libraries. The tool is simple to use and provides insights into potential security risks within a target network or website.

## Features
##### Network Scanning: Identifies hosts within a specified IP range.
##### Port Scanning: Scans common ports (1-1024) on detected hosts to identify open ports.
##### Software Version Checking: Fetches and displays the server software version from HTTP headers for web servers running on detected hosts.
###### Misconfiguration Detection: Highlights open ports and outdated software versions that could indicate potential vulnerabilities.
